## About the project

This is an app to quickly navigate and search for movies which you can add to your favorite list. 
The app was built according to MVVM structure. The data is pulled from https://imdb-api.com/api.
There are three bottom navigation buttons which are represented by separate fragments. Also, all cardviews are clickable and will pop a movie fragment with more information about the title. 
The lists are represented through recyvlerview. Some of the lists are saved in local memory using room so that they could be accessed through multiple uses. Others are pulled straight through retrofit2.Â
